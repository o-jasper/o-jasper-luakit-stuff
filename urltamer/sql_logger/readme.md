# SQL logging
Logs how sites connect with SQL, and can show with listview.

Main forseen purpose is to be able to quickly produce patterns to (not)block.

However, it is basically a history browser, but views a bit messy right now
because *every* asset of a site registers. If all implied links can
easily be hidden, perhaps.

Perhaps needs a better way how it puts it into SQL. I.e. there is a uri in a
window-viewed-this entry and the other entries refer to that.
