General sql viewer. Idea:

* Users need to make profiles of SQL tables.
  + Basically filling in the information in there right now. 
  + Includes i.e. indicating that other tables serve to provide tags.
  + Includes filenames of where the files are.
    
* Profiles each then have their search page.

* Profiles need to be savable. Again SQL table to contain profiles, i guess.
