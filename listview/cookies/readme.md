# Cookie listview viewer.

Silly how long i took before i realized i should add it.
It is still *very* basic.(though quite a lot of other things here
i want more advanced) Want:

* Show expiry data as time properly. Possibly using relative time indication,
  like other things.
  (dont reshow the day/month/year if the lastAccessed day/month/year is just the same)
* Maybe good to bunch them together under a host/path a bit.
* Show `isSecure`, `isHttpOnly` more neatly.
* Integrate with history perhaps..
  (like an infofun/listview integrating a bunch of things)
