Gui modification based on table and a "scrolling div".

### TODO:

* It doesnt load more, monitor the scrolling area to load when going down there.

* It doesnt seem to enforce `max-height:60%`, instead needing to resort to height
  in pixels.
  
  Fix this, preferably in html/css, but i dont see how, so possibly need to get
  the window height.
