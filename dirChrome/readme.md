# Directory viewer

# TODO

* Currently aware of current directory, *but* doesnt use it enough to show it.

  + Defaultly search for current directory exactly, and hide the search bar.

* Have more order-by options. Probably want:(at least)
  + Modify date (current)
  + Size.
  + Alphabetically.

* Way to indicate types of files as special.

  For instance `readme.md` as "text of the directory", and taking other
  `.md` files as showable.
  
* Deal with it when files/directories may not be accessed.

* (optionally, defaultly)Hide dot files
