# Better history browser..
Does an sql search in the existing history table.

Uses this [general (sql)list viewer](https://github.com/o-jasper/o-jasper-luakit-stuff/tree/master/listview#list-view-lib--messages-lib). check the readme there for 
what the search can do. In short, you can view the SQL command at any time,
edit and use that if you want, and it has stuff like `after:` `title:` `uri:`
etc. 
(like `site:` but that is one that happens to be missing now. Though there is
`like:`)
