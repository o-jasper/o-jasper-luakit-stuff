# Bunch of [luakit](http://mason-larobina.github.io/luakit/) things

Each directory has a readme. Note that
[it depends on this pull request](https://github.com/o-jasper/o-jasper-luakit-stuff/tree/master/search_login#log-in-using-pass).

* [search_login](https://github.com/o-jasper/o-jasper-luakit-stuff/tree/master/search_login#log-in-using-pass), which uses `pass` and searching the html to login.
* [urltamer](https://github.com/o-jasper/o-jasper-luakit-stuff/tree/master/urltamer#taming-the-urls-that-are-accessed), running code based on `uri` being accessed,
  blocking/redirecting/managing view behavior based on them.
* [listview](https://github.com/o-jasper/o-jasper-luakit-stuff/tree/master/listview#list-view-lib--messages-lib)
  searching SQL, however, might end up just doing so over 
  logs, messages, bookmarks, history. (limited extent)

Note that although it is called `o-jasper-luakit-stuff`, i dont mean that it is
just my project. Just not-clogging the namespace, and getting all the damn
things in one repo.
